 * The store is the single object where data is stored.
 * Every component has a way to access this data as well as update its contents.
 *
 * Reducers are the business logic functions for updating the state
 * Reducers must be pure functions; that is, every input must have the same output
 * and have no side effects, otherwise, bugs are more likely to occur.
 * This is because the store is a single object and can be updated through references.
 * Normally you would create shallow copies of the storeâ€™s data at every level you require change.
 * However, with Redux toolkit, you no longer have to create shallow copies
 * due to its use of the Immer library.
 *
 * Actions are the way the store will know which Reducer should be used to handle data updates of the store.
 * Actions contain a type, which specify the key of the reducer, as well as the data you
 * intend to send to the reducer to use.
 *
 * Action creators are the functions that creates the action objects.
